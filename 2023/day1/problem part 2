--- Part Two ---

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine 29 - two 1 nine - 219
eightwothree 83 - eight two three - 823
abcone2threexyz 13 - one 2 three - 123
xtwone3four 24 - two one 3 four - 2134
4nineeightseven2 - 4 nine eight sever 2 - 49872
zoneight234 - one eight 2 3 4 - 18234
7pqrstsixteen - 7 six - 76

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
